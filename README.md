# Practical Interview Questions

> ### The aim of this repository is to mimic day-to-day task of a software engineer in an interview for most organizations

### Allow searching on Internet during Coding exercise

## Structure of Repository

- 1st layer is the type of interview. For now For now, I am only adding coding exercise. But feel free to contribute other parts. Such as SQL or System Design.
- 2nd layer is level of difficulty. I wasn't sure how we can separate the levels, so I gae numbers instead of position. `level-1` means easy and can be asked to a fresher. `level-2` can be asked to SDE2 and so on.
- 3rd layer is the actual problem statement inside dedicated `.md` file. `.MD` file represent the question or problem statements.

- Candidate is able to communicate his solution to you
- readable and clean code

- and any other criteria required for the job position and organization
